# Regression
Shows regression analysis -

Using single feature, multi feature, polynomial, ridge and lasso regression techniques, an attempt has been made to predict housing prices.
Feature selection - univariate type has been used to segregate features to be considered. 
Also, importance of features has been taken into consideration.
There are several other types of reression as well. Will be updating the prediction as I learn more techniques.
